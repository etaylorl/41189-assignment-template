Taylor Liew Group 2 Peer review - Education 

There are some aspects of the report with grammatical errors which makes it harder to fully read and understand the situation of the problem. It would be best to read through this out loud to ensure it makes sense for a new reader. The background research and information is done to a high standard and gives a good understanding of the problem and literature as evidence to back this up. As well as evidence of a range of current models that are being used to address this problem. 

There is also no rich picture evident in the Github repository, which should be worked on for the final assignment, as this helps to visually identify the interaction of the system and stakeholders. This system is a complex system meaning interaction between outer boundaries and stakeholders needs to be shown. 

The conceptual models are well set out and easy to read and follow through the information. It is good to see in text referencing to back up this information that is logically set out. It would be nice to also implement some diagrams and visuals to make it easier for the reader to understand and break up the text. 

Overall, this is a very interesting and relevant topic with good background information to support the understanding for the reader. It would be good to add more relevant diagrams and visuals for the reader to be able to understand the models clearly.
